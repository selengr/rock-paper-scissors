## Definition

**Rock paper scissors** (_also known as scissors rock paper and scissors paper stone_) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (_a closed fist_), "paper" (_a flat hand_), and "scissors" (_a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V_). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (_also indicating "victory" or "peace"_) except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air. A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.(_source: Wikipedia_)

Anyone between the ages of _3 and beyond_.

# Why I chose this game?

I thought it was an interesting and original way yo display skills using the tools given and the assigned time. I was particularly inspired by the **Afiniti** version of **Rock Paper Scissors**. In this version the user can play against an IA player who learns from their every move.

I made this game as part of my first project assignment for **General Assembly** coding bootcamp.

Here are other reasons to play **Rock paper Scissors** from the WRPSA (_The World Rock Paper Scissors Association_)

-   No Age Requirement to Play
-   No need for training to compete at a professional level
-   No physical barriers to Play
-   No one is naturally better at the sport then anyone else
-   There is no setup required to start the game
-   No cleanup after the game is over
-   Allows for quick decision making
-   There is no age or gender bias

# History

The earliest form of **Rock Paper Scissors** was created in Japan and is called **Janken**. This is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century. **Janken** uses the Rock, Paper and Scissors signs. It is the game that the modern version of **Rock Paper Scissors** derives from directly. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th Century. This was between the Edo and Meiji periods.(source: Wikipedia)

# The Game

**Rock Paper Scissors** is a zero sum game that is usually played by two people using their hands and no tools. The idea is to make shapes with an outstretched hand where each shape will have a certain degree of power and will lead to an outcome.(_source: The World Rock Paper Scissors Association_)

# Instructions

Chose one of three options to play against the computer.
Once you have chosen, the computer would also make a choice.
A win, a lose or a draw message would be posted for each party.
There are three chances to win, lose and draw.

# Hardware Platform

This game is _web-based_ and can be played on desktop and laptop computers with no installation required. _Mobile_ option for phones and tablets needs optimization.

# Competition Mode

Two players

# Rules

-   Rock smashes scissors, rock wins
-   Paper covers Rock, paper wins
-   Scissors cut paper, scissors wins
-   Rock and rock, it's a draw
-   Paper and paper, it's a draw
-   Scissor and Scissors, it's a draw
-   Game ends after score reaches 3 by any outcome

# Strategy

Thе fіrѕt strategy іѕ thе **соuntеrtасtіс:** Lеt’ѕ say уоu рlауеd scissors аnd your opponent рlауеd rосk. Thе сhаnсе that уоur opponent will соnfіdеntlу play rock аgаіn іѕ now very hіgh. What thаt means tо уоu: аntісіраtе thаt аnd рlау paper. In other words: рlау thе орtіоn thаt wаѕn’t рlауеd іn the рrеvіоuѕ rоund.

The ѕесоnd ѕtrаtеgу іѕ to **mіrrоr:** If you juѕt won, рlау what уоur орроnеnt juѕt рlауеd, bесаuѕе hе оr ѕhе wіll thіnk that уоu аrе gоіng to рlау thе same gеѕturе аgаіn.(_source: The World Rock Paper Scissors Association_)

# The Making of the Game

I have encounter several obstacles while planing and making this game.
Functions under Javascript and behavior under CSS were the most challenging among the many hurtles that I encounter.

# Code Sample

```javascript
function computerPlay() {
    computerChoice = choices[Math.floor(Math.random() * choices.length)];
    calculateResults();
}
```

This code help me simulate the choices another player would make.(\_source: `GeeksforGeeks.com`)

# User Story

**Rock Paper Scissors** is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with a degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.(_source: Wikipedia_)

# Feedback

Robert Groves Feedback;
Hey Rixio, it's looking pretty good! I took some time just to play with the game and here are my thoughts:
Upon navigating to your URL and seeing the into screen, I thought it looked very nice with a comic/cartoon vibe to it, which may not appeal to everyone but I like it a lot and I see that you kept that vibe consistent throughout the game. Well done.
Upon first viewing the game screen, I thought I was supposed to click the "Ready To Play" text to start the game, then realized I was supposed to scroll down.
Possible ways to address this might be :

1. allow user to click "ready to play" and automatically scroll to bottom
2. Tweak the layout or the responsiveness of the design so that everything fits on one screen (this might be the better of these two options)
   The score text against that center of that "VS" background is a little noisy.
   Maybe give the background a slight grayscale filter (for an example of how to do that search "CSS filter grayscale function")
   When I played I noticed there was no definitive start to the next round, the result of the previous round is only shown.
   A possible way to address this is by maybe adding another line stating "Throw Again..." to the result message (ex: "You win! Throw Again...")
   As I continued playing I was jarred by the "IT'S A STALEMATE" screen as I wasn't expecting it. I didn't realize until playing a second time that there are only 6 rounds and then the game is over.
   A possible way to address this is by doing something like adding instructions (various ways to do this: could have them right at the top of the screen or could have a link that shows a modal pop up with instructions) explaining the rules and that there are six rounds. Something else you might think about adding is the round number to the message, something like "Round 1 of 6: You win!"
   I also didn't get to see the final score because it was no longer on screen at the end of the game.
   A possible way to address this is to include the final score in the end screen message, something like "You won the match with 4 wins and 2 draws."
   I noticed that I could select rock, and before the animation finished and that each time I clicked another selection of rock, paper, or scissor it would count as a round. So if you click rock 5 times in a row for example the game will almost immediately go to one of the end of game screens.
   A possible way to address this is to disable all options after one is selected and re-enable them after the round has played out.

I did play it a few times and everything seemed to be in working order. I did give the code a quick glance, but I didn't get to do a full code review. One thing that jumped out is this type of code was repeated in multiple spots where the game needed to be reset based on which end screen the user was about to click on:
loseScreen.style.display = 'none';
resetScores();
resetHands();
resetMessage();
You could isolate that code to a single function (maybe called resetGame(), you could pass in the screen object as an argument so you can set the display style, since that is the only thing that changes between them.
I'll try to do a more thorough code review if I have time later.
1:26
To recap, I think you've done a great job here.
1:27
One other, very minor note, add a favicon.ico file to your project's web root (even if just an empty file, to avoid the 404 that is received (see browser's Dev Tools when opening your page)

Here is something else, but don't think about this too much right now, just tuck it away in your notes somewhere and get your version 1.0 polished up for now. When you're ready think about taking on this challenge:
Future Challenge
Take your final version 1.0 of your game and create a version 2.0 with the code redesigned in a more object oriented style. For instance just looking a the visuals in the game you can think about some things as objects: the Scoreboard, the Player Options, the Battle Animation (I couldn't come up with a better name for the area that plays out the rock, paper, scissor round after the selection, but you get the point), the Game itself, etc..
Then think about these objects and what kind of responsibilities each would have and how each would interact with each other. For example, the Scoreboard object would be hide the scores from being global, it would be responsible for updating the current scores, it might have methods like incrementPlayerScore() incrementComputerScore to keep track of the scores and an update() method to keep the scoreboard that is shown to the player up to date as the scores change. The Player Options object might have a methods like disable() and enable() to control whether the rock, paper, scissors are clickable. The Game object could have methods like initialize(), reset(), playRound(), etc.
This will get you thinking and designing in an object oriented style. You can compare the two versions of the program after and compare and contrast the pros and cons of coding it each way. (edited)
